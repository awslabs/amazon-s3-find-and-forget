# Upgrade Guide

## Migrating from <=v0.8 to 0.9

The default behaviour of the solution has been changed in v0.9 to deploy and use
a purpose-built VPC when creating the solution CloudFormation stack.

If you have deployed the standalone VPC stack provided in previous versions, you
should should set `DeployVpc` to **true** when upgrading to v0.9 and input the
same values for the `FlowLogsGroup` and `FlowLogsRoleArn` parameters that were
used when deploying the standalone VPC stack. After the deployment of v0.9 is
complete, you should delete the old VPC stack.

To continue using an existing VPC, you must set `DeployVpc` to **false** when
upgrading to v0.9.
