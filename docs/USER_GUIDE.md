## Pre-requisites

### Configuring a VPC for the Solution

The Fargate tasks used by this solution to perform deletions must be able to
access the following AWS services, either via an Internet Gateway or via [VPC
Endpoints]:

- Amazon S3
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon CloudWatch (monitoring and logs)
- AWS ECR
- Amazon SQS
- AWS STS

#### Creating a New VPC

By default the CloudFormation template will create a new VPC that has been
purpose-built for the solution. The VPC includes VPC endpoints for the
aforementioned services, and does not provision internet connectivity.

You can use the provided VPC to operate the solution with no further
customisations. However, if you have more complex requirements it is recommended
to use an existing VPC as described in the following section.

#### Using an Existing VPC

Amazon S3 Find and Forget can also be used in an existing VPC. You may want to
do this if you have requirements that aren't met by using the VPC provided with
the solution.

To use an existing VPC, set the `DeployVpc` parameter to `false` when launching
the solution CloudFormation stack. You must also specify the subnet and security
groups that the Fargate tasks will use by setting the `VpcSubnets` and
`VpcSecurityGroups` parameters respectively.

The subnets and security groups that you specify must allow the tasks to connect
to the aforementioned AWS services. Forget solution, you must ensure that when
deploying the solution you select subnets and security groups which permit
access to the aforementioned services and you set _DeployVpc_ to false.

You can obtain your subnet and security group IDs from the AWS Console or by
using the AWS CLI. If using the AWS CLI, you can use the following command to
get a list of VPCs:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-vpcs \
  --query 'Vpcs[*].{ID:VpcId,Name:Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value | [0], IsDefault: IsDefault}'
```

Once you have found the VPC you wish to use, to get a list of subnets and
security groups in that VPC:

```bash
export VPC_ID=<chosen-vpc-id>
aws ec2 describe-subnets \
  --filter Name=vpc-id,Values="$VPC_ID" \
  --query 'Subnets[*].{ID:SubnetId,Name:Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value | [0],AZ:AvailabilityZone}'
aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
  --filter Name=vpc-id,Values="$VPC_ID" \
  --query 'SecurityGroups[*].{ID:GroupId,Name:GroupName}'
```

### Provisioning Data Access IAM Roles

The Fargate tasks used by this solution to perform deletions require a specific
IAM role to exist in each account that owns a bucket that you will use with the
solution. The role must have the exact name **S3F2DataAccessRole** (no path). A
CloudFormation template is available as part of this solution which can be
deployed separately to the main stack in each account. A way to deploy this role
to many accounts, for example across your organization, is to use [AWS
CloudFormation StackSets].

To deploy this template manually, use the IAM Role Template "Deploy to AWS
button" in [Deploying the Solution](#deploying-the-solution) then follow steps
5-9. The **Outputs** tab will contain the Role ARN which you will need when
adding data mappers.

You will need to grant this role read and write access to your data. We
recommend you do this using a bucket policy. For more information, see
[Granting Access to Data](#granting-access-to-data).

## Deploying the Solution

The solution is deployed as an
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) template and should
take about 20 to 40 minutes to deploy.

Your access to the AWS account must have IAM permissions to launch AWS
CloudFormation templates that create IAM roles and to create the solution
resources.

> **Note** You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while
> running this solution. For full details, see the pricing pages for each AWS
> service you will be using in this sample. Prices are subject to change.

1. Deploy the latest CloudFormation template using the AWS Console by choosing
   the "_Launch Template_" button below for your preferred AWS region. If you
   wish to [deploy using the AWS CLI] instead, you can refer to the "_Template
   Link_" to download the template files.

   When completed, click _Next_

5. [Configure stack options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html)
   if desired, then click _Next_.
6. On the review screen, you must check the boxes for:

   - "_I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources_"
   - "_I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with
     custom names_"

   These are required to allow CloudFormation to create a Role to allow access
   to resources needed by the stack and name the resources in a dynamic way.

7. Choose _Create Change Set_
8. On the _Change Set_ screen, click _Execute_ to launch your stack.
   - You may need to wait for the _Execution status_ of the change set to become
     "_AVAILABLE_" before the "_Execute_" button becomes available.
9. Wait for the CloudFormation stack to launch. Completion is indicated when the
   "Stack status" is "_CREATE_COMPLETE_".
   - You can monitor the stack creation progress in the "Events" tab.
10. Note the _WebUIUrl_ displayed in the _Outputs_ tab for the stack. This is
    used to access the application.

## Accessing the application

The solution provides a web user interface and a REST API to allow you to
integrate it in your own applications.

1. Note the _WebUIUrl_ displayed in the _Outputs_ tab for the stack. This is
   used to access the application.
2. When accessing the web user interface for the first time, you will be
   prompted to insert a username and a password. In the username field, enter
   the admin e-mail specified during stack creation. In the password field,
   enter the temporary password sent by the system to the admin e-mail. Then
   select "Sign In".
3. Next, you will need to reset the password. Enter a new password and then
   select "Submit".
4. Now you should be able to access all the functionalities.

To add more users to the application:

1. Access the [Cognito Console] and choose "Manage User Pools".
2. Select the solution's User Pool (its name is displayed as
   _CognitoUserPoolName_ in the _Outputs_ tab for the CloudFormation stack).
3. Select "Users and Groups" from the menu on the right.
4. Use this page to create or manage users. For more information, consult the
   [Managing Users in User Pools Guide].

In order to use the API, you will need to authenticate the requests using the
User Pool. For more information, consult the [Cognito REST API integration
guide].

## Configuring Data Mappers

After [Deploying the Solution](#deploying-the-solution), your first step should
be to configure one or more [data mappers](ARCHITECTURE.md#data-mappers) which
will connect your data to the solution. Identify the S3 Bucket containing the
data you wish to connect to the solution and ensure you have defined a table in
your data catalog and that all existing and future partitions (as they are
created) are known to the Data Catalog. Currently AWS Glue is the only supported
data catalog provider. For more information on defining your data in the Glue
Data Catalog, see [Defining Glue Tables]. You must define your Table in the Glue
Data Catalog in the same region and account as the S3 Find and Forget solution.

1. Access the application UI via the **WebUIUrl** displayed in the _Outputs_ tab
   for the stack.
2. Choose **Data Mappers** from the menu then choose **Create Data Mapper**
3. On the Create Data Mapper page input a **Name** to uniquely identify this
   Data Mapper.
4. Select a **Query Executor Type** then choose the **Database** and **Table**
   in your data catalog which describes the target data in S3. A list of columns
   will be displayed for the chosen Table.
5. From the list, choose the column(s) the solution should use to to find items
   in the data which should be deleted. For example, if your table has three
   columns named **customer_id**, **description** and **created_at** and you
   want to search for items using the **customer_id**, you should choose only
   the **customer_id** column from this list.
6. Enter the ARN of the role for Fargate to assume when modifying objects in S3
   buckets. This role should already exist if you have followed the
   [Provisioning Data Access IAM Roles](#provisioning-data-access-iam-roles)
   steps.
7. If you do not want the solution to delete all older versions except the
   latest created object version, deselect _Delete previous object versions
   after update_. By default the solution will delete all previous of versions
   after creating a new version.
8. Choose **Create Data Mapper**.
9. A message is displayed advising you to update the S3 Bucket Policy for the S3
   Bucket referenced by the newly created data mapper. See
   [Granting Access to Data](#granting-access-to-data) for more information on
   how to do this. Choose **Return to Data Mappers**.

You can also create Data Mappers directly via the API. For more information, see
the [API Documentation].

## Granting Access to Data

After configuring a data mapper you must ensure that the S3 Find and Forget
solution has the required level of access to the S3 location the data mapper
refers to. The recommended way to achieve this is through the use of [S3 Bucket
Policies].

> **Note:** AWS IAM uses an
> [eventual consistency model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency)
> and therefore any change you make to IAM, Bucket or KMS Key policies may take
> time to become visible. Ensure you have allowed time for permissions changes
> to propagate to all endpoints before starting a job. If your job fails with a
> status of FIND_FAILED and the `QueryFailed` events indicate S3 permissions
> issues, you may need to wait for the permissions changes to propagate.

### Updating your Bucket Policy

To update the S3 bucket policy to grant **read** access to the IAM role used by
Amazon Athena, and **write** access to the Data Access IAM role used by AWS
Fargate, follow these steps:

1. Access the application UI via the **WebUIUrl** displayed in the _Outputs_ tab
   for the stack.
2. Choose **Data Mappers** from the menu then choose the radio button for the
   relevant data mapper from the **Data Mappers** list.
3. Choose **Generate Access Policies** and follow the instructions on the
   **Bucket Access** tab to update the bucket policy. If you already have a
   bucket policy in place, add the statements shown to your existing bucket
   policy rather than replacing it completely. If your data is encrypted with an
   **Customer Managed CMK** rather than an **AWS Managed CMK**, see
   [Data Encrypted with Customer Managed CMK](#data-encrypted-with-a-customer-managed-cmk)
   to grant the solution access to the Customer Managed CMK. For more
   information on using Server-Side Encryption (SSE) with S3, see [Using SSE
   with CMKs].

### Data Encrypted with a Customer Managed CMK

Where the data you are connecting to the solution is encrypted with an Customer
Managed CMK rather than an AWS Managed CMK, you must also grant the Athena and
Data Access IAM roles access to use the key so that the data can be decrypted
when reading, re-encrypted when writing.

Once you have updated the bucket policy as described in
[Updating the Bucket Policy](#updating-the-bucket-policy), choose the **KMS
Access** tab from the **Generate Access Policies** modal window and follow the
instructions to update the key policy with the provided statements. The
statements provided are for use when using the **policy view** in the AWS
console or making updates to the key policy via the CLI, CloudFormation or the
API. If you wish, to use the **default view** in th AWS console, add the
**Principals** in the provided statements as **key users**. For more
information, see [How to Change a Key Policy].

## Adding to the Deletion Queue

Once your Data Mappers are configured, you can begin adding "Matches" to the
[Deletion Queue](ARCHITECTURE.md#deletion-queue).

1. Access the application UI via the **WebUIUrl** displayed in the _Outputs_ tab
   for the stack.
2. Choose **Deletion Queue** from the menu then choose **Add Match to the
   Deletion Queue**.
3. Input a **Match**, which is the value to search for in your data mappers. If
   you wish to search for the match from all data mappers choose **All Data
   Mappers**, otherwise choose **Select your Data Mappers** then select the
   relevant data mappers from the list.
4. Choose **Add Item to the Deletion Queue** and confirm you can see the match
   in the Deletion Queue.

You can also add matches to the Deletion Queue directly via the API. For more
information, see the [API Documentation].

When the next deletion job runs, the solution will scan the configured columns
of your data for any occurrences of the Matches present in the queue at the time
the job starts and remove any items where one of the Matches is present.

If across all your data mappers you can find all items related to a single
logical entity using the same value, you only need to add one Match value to the
deletion queue to delete that logical entity from all data mappers.

If the value used to identify a single logical entity is not consistent across
your data mappers, you should add an item to the deletion queue **for each
distinct value** which identifies the logical entity, selecting the specific
data mapper(s) to which that value is relevant.

If you make a mistake when adding a Match to the deletion queue, you can remove
that match from the queue as long as there is no job running. Once a job has
started no items can be removed from the deletion queue until the running job
has completed. You may continue to add matches to the queue whilst a job is
running, but only matches which were present when the job started will be
processed by that job. Once a job completes, only the matches that job has
processed will be removed from the queue.

In order to facilitate different teams using a single deployment within an
organisation, the same match can be added to the deletion queue more than once.
When the job executes, it will merge the lists of data mappers for duplicates in
the queue.

## Running a Deletion Job

Once you have configured your data mappers and added one or more items to the
deletion queue, you can stat a job.

1. Access the application UI via the **WebUIUrl** displayed in the _Outputs_ tab
   for the stack.
2. Choose **Deletion Jobs** from the menu and ensure there are no jobs currently
   running. Choose **Start a Deletion Job** and review the settings displayed on
   the screen. For more information on how to edit these settings, see
   [Adjusting Configuration](#adjusting-configuration).
3. If you are happy with the current solution configuration choose **Start a
   Deletion Job**. The job details page should be displayed.

Once a job has started, you can leave the page and return to view its progress
at point by choosing the job ID from the Deletion Jobs list. The job details
page will automatically refresh and to display the current status and statistics
for the job. For more information on the possible statuses and their meaning,
see [Deletion Job Statuses](#deletion-job-statuses).

You can also start jobs and check their status using the API. For more
information, see the [API Documentation].

Job events are continuously emitted whilst a job is running. These events are
used to update the status and statistics for the job. You can view all the
emitted events for a job in the **Job Events** table. Whilst a job is running,
the **Load More** button will continue to be displayed even if no new events
have been received. Once a job has finished, the **Load More** button will
disappear once you have loaded all the emitted events. For more information on
the events which can be emitted during a job, see
[Deletion Job Event Types](#deletion-job-event-types)

To optimise costs, it is best practice when using the solution to start jobs on
a regular schedule, rather than every time a single item is added to the
Deletion Queue. This is because the marginal cost of the Find phase when
deleting an additional item from the queue is far less that re-executing the
Find phase (where the data mappers searched are the same). Similarly, the
marginal cost of removing an additional match from an object is negligible when
there is already at least 1 match present in the object contents.

> **Important**
>
> Ensure no external processes perform write/delete actions against exist
> objects whilst a job is running. For more information, consult the [Limits]
> guide

### Deletion Job Statuses

The list of possible job statuses is as follows:

- `QUEUED`: The job has been accepted but has yet to start. Jobs are started
  asynchronously by a Lambda invoked by the [DynamoDB event
  stream][dynamodb streams] for the Jobs table.
- `RUNNING`: The job is still in progress.
- `FORGET_COMPLETED_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS`: The job is still in progress.
- `COMPLETED`: The job finished successfully.
- `COMPLETED_CLEANUP_FAILED`: The job finished successfully however the deletion
  queue items could not be removed. You should manually remove these or leave
  them to be removed on the next job
- `FORGET_PARTIALLY_FAILED`: The job finished but it was unable to successfully
  process one or more objects. The Deletion DLQ for messages will contain a
  message per object that could not be updated.
- `FIND_FAILED`: The job failed during the Find phase as there was an issue
  querying one or more data mappers.
- `FORGET_FAILED`: The job failed during the Forget phase as there was an issue
  running the Fargate tasks.
- `FAILED`: An unknown error occurred during the Find and Forget workflow, for
  example, the Step Functions execution timed out or the execution was manually
  cancelled.

For more information on how to resolve statuses indicative of errors, consult
the [Troubleshooting] guide.

### Deletion Job Event Types

The list of events is as follows:

- `JobStarted`: Emitted when the deletion job state machine first starts. Causes
  the status of the job to transition from `QUEUED` to `RUNNING`
- `FindPhaseStarted`: Emitted when the deletion job has purged any messages from
  the query and object queues and is ready to be searching for data.
- `FindPhaseEnded`: Emitted when all queries have executed and written their
  results to the objects queue.
- `FindPhaseFailed`: Emitted when one or more queries fail. Causes the status to
  transition to `FIND_FAILED`.
- `ForgetPhaseStarted`: Emitted when the Find phase has completed successfully
  and the Forget phase is starting.
- `ForgetPhaseEnded`: Emitted when the Forget phase has completed. If the Forget
  phase completes with no errors, this event causes the status to transition to
  `FORGET_COMPLETED_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS`. If the Forget phase completes but
  there was an error updating one or more objects, this causes the status to
  transition to `FORGET_PARTIALLY_FAILED`.
- `ForgetPhaseFailed`: Emitted when there was an issue running the Fargate
  tasks. Causes the status to transition to `FORGET_FAILED`.
- `CleanupSucceeded`: The **final** event emitted when a job has executed
  successfully and the Deletion Queue has been cleaned up. Causes the status to
  transition to `COMPLETED`.
- `CleanupFailed`: The **final** event emitted when the job executed
  successfully but there was an error removing the processed matches from the
  Deletion Queue. Causes the status to transition to `COMPLETED_CLEANUP_FAILED`.
- `CleanupSkipped`: Emitted when the job is finalising and the job status is one
  of `FIND_FAILED`, `FORGET_FAILED` or `FAILED`.
- `QuerySucceeded`: Emitted whenever a single query executes successfully.
- `QueryFailed`: Emitted whenever a single query fails.
- `ObjectUpdated`: Emitted whenever an updated object is written to S3 and any
  associated deletions are complete.
- `ObjectUpdateFailed`: Emitted whenever an object cannot be updated, an object
  version integrity conflict is detected or an associated deletion fails.
- `ObjectRollbackFailed`: Emitted whenever a rollback (triggered by a detected
  version integrity conflict) fails.
- `Exception`: Emitted whenever a generic error occurs during the job execution.
  Causes the status to transition to `FAILED`.

## Adjusting Configuration

There are several parameters to set when
[Deploying the Solution](#deploying-the-solution) which affect the behaviour of
the solution in terms of data retention and performance:

- `AthenaConcurrencyLimit`: Increasing the number of concurrent queries that
  should be executed will decrease the total time spent performing the Find
  phase. You should not increase this value beyond your account Service Quota
  for concurrent DML queries, and should ensure that the value set takes into
  account any other Athena DML queries that may be executing whilst a job is
  running.
- `DeletionTasksMaxNumber`: Increasing the number of concurrent tasks that
  should consume messages from the object queue will decrease the total time
  spent performing the Forget phase.
- `QueryExecutionWaitSeconds`: Decreasing this value will decrease the length of
  time between each check to see whether a query has completed. You should aim
  to set this to the "ceiling function" of your average query time. For example,
  if you average query takes 3.2 seconds, set this to 4.
- `QueryQueueWaitSeconds`: Decreasing this value will decrease the length of
  time between each check to see whether additional queries can be scheduled
  during the Find phase. If your jobs fail due to exceeding the Step Functions
  execution history quota, you may have set this value to low and should
  increase it to allow more queries to be scheduled after each check.
- `ForgetQueueWaitSeconds`: Decreasing this value will decrease the length of
  time between each check to see whether the Fargate object queue is empty. If
  your jobs fail due to exceeding the Step Functions execution history quota,
  you may have set this value to low.
- `JobDetailsRetentionDays`: Changing this value will change how long records
  job details and events are retained for. Set this to 0 to retain them
  indefinitely.

The values for these parameters are stored in an SSM Parameter Store String
Parameter named `/s3f2/S3F2-Configuration` as a JSON object. The recommended
approach for updating these values is to perform a
[Stack Update](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-direct.html)
and change the relevant parameters for the stack.

It is possible to [update the SSM Parameter][updating an ssm parameter] directly
however this is not a recommended approach. **You should not alter the structure
or data types of the configuration JSON object.**

Once updated, the configuration will affect any **future** job executions. In
progress and previous executions will **not** be affected. The current
configuration values are displayed when confirming that you wish to start a job.

You can only update the vCPUs/memory allocated to Fargate tasks by performing a
stack update. For more information, see
[Updating the Solution](#updating-the-solution).

## Updating the Solution

To benefit from the latest features and improvements, you should update the
solution deployed to your account when a new version is published. To find out
what the latest version is and what has changed since your currently deployed
version, check the [Changelog].

How you update the solution depends on the difference between versions. If the
new version is a _minor_ upgrade (for instance, from version 3.45 to 3.67) you
should deploy using a CloudFormation Stack Update. If the new version is a
_major_ upgrade (for instance, from 2.34 to 3.0) you should perform a manual
rolling deployment.

Major version releases are made in exceptional circumstances and may contain
changes that prohibit backward compatibility. Minor versions releases are
backward-compatible.

### Identify current solution version

You can find the version of the currently deployed solution by retrieving the
`SolutionVersion` output for the solution stack. The solution version is also
shown on the Dashboard of the Web UI.

### Identify the Stack URL to deploy

After reviewing the [Changelog], obtain the `Template Link` url of the latest
version from ["Deploying the Solution"](#deploying-the-solution) (it will be
similar to
`https://solution-builders-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/amazon-s3-find-and-forget/latest/template.yaml`).
If you wish to deploy a specific version rather than the latest version, replace
`latest` from the url with the chosen version, for instance
`https://solution-builders-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/amazon-s3-find-and-forget/v0.2/template.yaml`.

### Minor Upgrades: Perform CloudFormation Stack Update

To deploy via AWS Console:

1. Open the [CloudFormation Console Page] and choose the Solution by selecting
   to the stack's radio button, then choose "Update"
2. Choose "Replace current template" and then input the template URL for the
   version you wish to deploy in the "Amazon S3 URL" textbox, then choose "Next"
3. On the _Stack Details_ screen, review the Parameters and then choose "Next"
4. On the _Configure stack options_ screen, choose "Next"
5. On the _Review stack_ screen, you must check the boxes for:

   - "_I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources_"
   - "_I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with
     custom names_"
   - "_I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might require the following
     capability: CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND_"

   These are required to allow CloudFormation to create a Role to allow access
   to resources needed by the stack and name the resources in a dynamic way.

6. Choose "Update stack" to start the stack update.
7. Wait for the CloudFormation stack to finish updating. Completion is indicated
   when the "Stack status" is "_UPDATE_COMPLETE_".

To deploy via the AWS CLI
[consult the documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html).

### Major Upgrades: Manual Rolling Deployment

The process for a manual rolling deployment is as follows:

1. Create a new stack from scratch
2. Export the data from the old stack to the new stack
3. Migrate consumers to new API and Web UI URLs
4. Delete the old stack.

The steps for performing this process are:

1. Deploy a new instance of the Solution by following the instructions contained
   in the ["Deploying the Solution" section](#deploying-the-solution). Make sure
   you use unique values for Stack Name and ResourcePrefix parameter which
   differ from existing stack.
2. Migrate Data from DynamoDB to ensure the new stack contains the necessary
   configuration related to Data Mappers and settings. When both stacks are
   deployed in the same account and region, the simplest way to migrate is via
   [On-Demand Backup and Restore]. If the stacks are deployed in different
   regions or accounts, you can use [AWS Data Pipeline].
3. Ensure that all the bucket policies for the Data Mappers are in place for the
   new stack. See the
   ["Granting Access to Data" section](#granting-access-to-data) for steps to do
   this.
4. Review the [Changelog] for changes that may affect how you use the new
   deployment. This may require you to make changes to any software you have
   that interacts with the solution's API.
5. Once all the consumers are migrated to the new stack (API and Web UI), delete
   the old stack.

## Deleting the Solution

To delete a stack via AWS Console:

1. Open the [CloudFormation Console Page] and choose the solution stack, then
   choose "Delete"
2. Once the confirmation modal appears, choose "Delete stack".
3. Wait for the CloudFormation stack to finish updating. Completion is indicated
   when the "Stack status" is "_DELETE_COMPLETE_".
