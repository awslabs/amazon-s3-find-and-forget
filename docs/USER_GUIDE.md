# User Guide

This section describes how to install, configure and use the Amazon S3 Find and
Forget solution.

## Deploying the Solution

The solution is deployed as an
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) template.

Your access to the AWS account must have IAM permissions to launch AWS
CloudFormation templates that create IAM roles and to create the solution
resources.

> **Note** You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while
> running this solution. For full details, see the pricing pages for each AWS
> service you will be using in this sample. Prices are subject to change.

2. If prompted, login using your AWS account credentials.
3. You should see a screen titled "*Create Stack*" at the "*Specify template*"
   step. The fields specifying the CloudFormation template are pre-populated.
   Click the *Next* button at the bottom of the page.
4. On the "*Specify stack details*" screen you should provide values for the
   following parameters of the CloudFormation stack:
   * **Stack Name:** (Default: S3F2) This is the name that is used to refer to
   this stack in CloudFormation once deployed.
   * **AdminEmail:** The email address you wish to setup as the initial
   user of this Amazon S3 Find and Forget deployment.
   * **SafeMode:** (Default: true) Whether to operate in safe mode. Whilst Safe
   Mode is set to true, updated objects will be written to a temporary bucket
   instead of overwriting the original object. For more information see
   [Disabling Safe Mode](#disabling-safe-mode)
   
   The following parameters are optional and allow further customisation of the
   solution if required:
   
   * **VpcIpBlock:** (Default: 10.0.0.0/16) CIDR range to use for the VPC.
   * **PrivateSubnetIpBlocks:** (Default: "10.0.0.0/22, 10.0.4.0/22, 10.0.8.0/22")
   CIDR ranges to assign to private subnets.
   * **CreateCloudFrontDistribution:** (Default: true) Creates a CloudFront
   distribution for accessing the web interface of the solution.
   * **AccessControlAllowOriginOverride:** (Default: false) Allows overriding
   the origin from which the API can be called. If 'false' is provided, the
   API will only accept requests from the Web UI origin.
   * **AthenaConcurrencyLimit:** (Default: 20) The number of concurrent Athena
   queries the solution will run when scanning your data lake.
   * **DeletionTasksMaxNumber:** (Default: 3)  Max number of concurrent 
   Fargate tasks to run when performing deletions.
   * **DeletionTaskCPU:** (Default: 4096) Fargate task CPU limit. For more info
   see [Fargate Configuration]
   * **DeletionTaskMemory:** (Default: 30720) Fargate task memory limit. For
   more info see [Fargate Configuration]
   * **WaitDurationQueryExecution:** (Default: 3) How long to wait when
   checking if an Athena Query has completed.
   * **WaitDurationQueryQueue:** (Default: 3)  How long to wait when
   checking if there the current number of executing queries is less than the
   specified concurrency limit.
   * **WaitDurationForgetQueue:** (Default: 30) How long to wait when
   checking if the Forget phase is complete
   * **AthenaWorkGroup:** (Default: primary) The Athena work group that should
   be used for when the solution runs Athena queries.
   * **EnableContainerInsights:** (Default: false) Whether to enable CloudWatch
   Container Insights.
   * **PreBuiltArtefactsBucketOverride:** (Default: false) Overrides the default
   Bucket containing Front-end and Back-end pre-built artefacts. Use this

   * **ResourcePrefix:** (Default: S3F2) Resource prefix to apply to resource
   names when creating statically named resources.

   When completed, click *Next*
5. [Configure stack options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html) if desired, then click *Next*.
6. On the review you screen, you must check the boxes for:
   * "*I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*" 
   * "*I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources
   with custom names*" 

   These are required to allow CloudFormation to create a Role to allow access
   to resources needed by the stack and name the resources in a dynamic way.
7. Click *Create Change Set* 
8. On the *Change Set* screen, click *Execute* to launch your stack.
   * You may need to wait for the *Execution status* of the change set to
   become "*AVAILABLE*" before the "*Execute*" button becomes available.
9. Wait for the CloudFormation stack to launch. Completion is indicated when
   the "Stack status" is "*CREATE_COMPLETE*".
   * You can monitor the stack creation progress in the "Events" tab.
10. Note the *WebUIUrl* displayed in the *Outputs* tab for the stack. This is
   used to access the application.
