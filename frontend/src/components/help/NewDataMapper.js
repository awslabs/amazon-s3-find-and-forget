    <h2>Create a Data Mapper</h2>
    <p className="separator-top">
      Data mappers enable you to connect data hosted in S3 to the Amazon S3
      Find and Forget solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      When creating a data mapper you need to choose a table in a
      supported <strong>data catalog provider</strong> which describes the
      location and structure of the data you want to connect to the solution.
      Currently, <strong>AWS Glue</strong> is the only supported data catalog
      provider. You must also choose a <strong>query executor</strong> which is
      the service the Amazon S3 Find and Forget solution will use to query the
      data. Currently, <strong>Amazon Athena</strong> is the only supported
      query executor. After selecting a query executor, you must to choose the
      columns in which to search for matches. The columns for your data are
      defined in the data catalog table.
    </p>
    <p>
      After creating a data mapper, you must update the S3 Bucket
      Policy for the S3 Bucket referenced by the data mapper to grant read
      permission to the IAM role assumed by the query executor (e.g. Amazon
      Athena), and read/write permission to the IAM role used by AWS Fargate
      to perform any required deletions.
    </p>
    <p className="separator-bottom">
      The deletion task requires you to have provisioned the <strong>S3F2DataAccessRole</strong>{" "}
      in the account which owns the bucket referenced by the data mapper.
      For more information on how to provision this role, check the{" "}
